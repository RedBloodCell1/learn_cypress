Day 1: 0:00:00 - 1:06:32 (2 hours 47 minutes of study)

Today, im gonna learn all the basic things about Cypress and write all the important information here.

The link of video that i'm using is listed:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8vMu7viCm8 (Testing JavaScript with Cypress â€“ Full Course)

Okay, it actually took me an hour just to set up things right.
IDK what the error is, it has something to do with package-lock.json.
If you guys encounter the same error while doing this practice, try updating your node.js version. Or idk, just open this link:

Okay now, lets actually start studying

Fundamentals:

1. Describe Blocks:

- Test will exist in a describe block
- The describe block take 2 argument
- First = Description (String) Which will describing your test file
- Second = Callback function in which you are going to have your actual test

2. It Blocks:

- Within describe blocks, we have It Blocks
- It blocks = single test within an overall test file
- The way to use it block is similar to describe block
- First arg = Title of an individual test
- Second arg = Callback function containing your test code

3. Commands & Interacting with elements

- Cypress have various commands to help testing
- The command can be used in the **cy** object
- For example you can use cy.visit('/') to access the baseurl of your site

List of command:

- cy.visit()
- cy.click()
- cy.type()
- cy.check()
- ETC

One of the most important crucial Cypress concepts that you need to understand is **Cypress handles things asynchronously**.
Cypress commands do not return their subjects. From what i understand??? I understand nothing right now xdd.
Assigning a variable is not recommended. Cypress commands yield their subjects.

Using .then() to interact with subject directly. .then() behaves similarly to promises in JS.

4. Gettings elements

- We of course often need to get an element from the DOM and make an assertion. For example, an h1 element contains certain text which you can get by using get function and pass in a CSS query selector

5. Command chaining & Assertions

- After getting an element, we probably want to do something with that element for example making an assertion.
- You can do this by chaining on an assertion after getting an element
- Example: get(h1).contains('text')

6. Focus on a single test

- Use it.only() to run only a single test

7. beforeEach()

- within the testing box, we can also use a beforeEach command to perform certain action prior to every test

8. Custom commands

- We aren't limited to only using cy.X commands
- We can create our own custom commands to cypress/support/commands.ts
- For example we can add a custom command getData to get an element by data-test

What i learn:

- You don't want to write test that rely on something like css class that change a lot (To make it not flaky). Meaning if something changed a little bit, you dont want the code to break on something not trivial at all. you want to use most of the time data-test.
- npx cypress open = to open cypress app

So today i have learned enough to understand the fundamentals of cypress, next, i will be finishing all the video and learn detox for the next one. Talking about detoxxxx...... Okay i have not been detoxing for a while but i guess its gonna be fine. I will be more responsible and actually study a lot. See you guys tomorrow
